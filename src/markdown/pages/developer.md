title: Developer
---

Moi! My name is Michael Utz, and I just moved to Finland from the United States
with my wife. She's a researcher at the University of Helsinki, and I'm a web
developer by trade (and by passion).

I've been tinkering around on the web since people were arguing about whether or
not it was _too soon_ to use CSS3 pseudo-selectors...so perhaps that dates me a
bit. I am an early adopter by nature, though, and I threw myself in the deep
end—quirks mode be damned! :)

In college, I studied music—focusing mostly on audio production and composition.
For my classes, I used a music notation software program called Sibelius, not
realizing that one day I'd literally live a kilometer from the Sibelius
monument.

The college I went to used it's competitor, Finale. I found Finale to be an
inelegant solution to the problem of writing music on the computer, even though
it was the industry leader. So, I saved up money for Sibelius, bought it, and
taught myself.

I got my homework done SO much faster than my classmates, and had a better time
doing it! I even had time left over to help some of my classmates learn
Sibelius. So, after I graduated, the chair of the music department invited me to
teach a course on Sibelius as an adjunct faculty member.

I say all that to demonstrate a few key things:

1. I've always been passionate about good software design,
2. I've always been fascinated with the intersection of beauty and technology,
   and
3. It sounds cool to say you were a college lecturer. (You're always supposed to
   have three items on these kinds of lists, right?) :)

Since I got my first computer in high school, I've spent an _inordinate_ amount
of my free time making things. At first it was mostly dinky websites,
spectacularly intricate Excel spreadsheets, amateurish symphonies, custom
Myspace profiles, or over-processed Photoshop images.

But after college I really started to dig into PHP and JavaScript. I wrote
numerous terrible WordPress themes, got familiar with the jQuery API back when
that was cool, and was pretty content with my tinkering. Until I got my first
job at a real software company.

I was working in the marketing department as a hybrid content writer / front-end
developer. When I started rewriting the company's website, the Lead Software
Architect started looking over my shoulder. Rightfully, he was horrified. :)

But, his mentorship and guidance helped me grow past my hacky, immature approach
to writing software. He gave me books on Clean Code and Design Patterns. He
forced me to learn a bit about Java so I could understand why my carelessness in
PHP and JavaScript was just shooting myself in the foot. And he was generally
patient and understanding.

My last five years of growth in software development springs from his generous
contribution to my life. However, I feel like I've reached a point with my
skills where it's time again to come under the guidance of someone a little
further down the path. While I'm confident in my knowledge of The Basics™ and
I'm confident in my ability to learn, I _know_ there are things that I don't
know I don't know.

So, that's what I want most out of a job—a place where I can continue to develop
my passion of making beautiful software. From what I've gathered, Futurice is
_the_ place to do just that in Finland.

If you want to see some of the stuff I've done, you can visit [my

GitHub, etc. I'd love to hear back from you! And, if you got this far, thanks
for reading!
